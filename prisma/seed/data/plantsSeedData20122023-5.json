When exposed to high winds, the trees can suffer branch damage, breakage or even uprooting. Furthermore, strong winds can agitate the leaves of the tree, causing the delicate fruit to drop prematurely. To protect a fig tree from strong winds, one can build a windbreak or lattice structure around the tree, which will reduce the impact of wind on the tree. Alternatively, one can build a simple trellis and use guide wires to support the branches of the tree against strong winds.","tags":["fig","fig tree","fruit tree","plants gardening","fruits"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1119U6FC64da73466083112/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1119U6FC64da73466083112/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1119U6FC64da73466083112/medium.jpg"}},{"id":1120,"question":"Do fig trees have a long lifespan?","answer":"Yes, fig trees have a long lifespan.

It is a tropical/semi-tropical species of fig, belonging to the family Moraceae, which is composed of around 850 species of trees and shrubs. The rubber plant is a large, evergreen tree native to South and Southeast Asia, and can grow to a height of over 100 feet in the wild. It has large, oval, leathery leaves that are often dark green with lighter spots, hence why it is sometimes referred to as the \"Leafy Elephant Ear\".","tags":["rubber plant","flowering plants","gardening","plants","flowers"],"default_image":null},{"id":358,"question":"Is the rubber plant a flowering plant?","answer":"No, the rubber plant (Ficus elastica or Ficus robusta) is not a flowering plant. Instead, it is an evergreen tree or large evergreen shrub that is part of the fig family (also known as Ficus). It has leathery, dark green leaves with reddish-brown stems and can grow to heights of 10‒15 m tall. It is native to the tropics of Southeast Asia and its sap is used to make rubber.","tags":["rubber plant","flowering plants","plants","gardening","flowers"],"default_image":null},{"id":365,"question":"Is the rubber plant a good air purifier?","answer":"Yes, the rubber plant is a great air purifier! The rubber tree is a species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia and an excellent houseplant for improving indoor air quality. It excels at removing airborne pollutants, particularly formaldehyde and benzene, from the air and helps remove bacteria and other materials from the air that can cause allergic reactions. The rubber plant's broad leaves are an effective filter for pollen, dust, and other allergens. This is why the rubber plant is widely recognized as an ideal air purifier for the home or office.","tags":["rubber plant","air purifier plants","gardening","indoor plants","flowers"],"default_image":null},{"id":1111,"question":"Is the fig tree a deciduous plant?","answer":"Yes, the fig tree is a deciduous plant. This means that each year, they lose their leaves and go into a dormant state during the cold months.

There are over 750 species, including the common edible fig as well as ornamental figs such as the Lebanese and Tiger Eye figs. Figs can be found in many climates and soils, with some that are semi-tropical and cold hardy. Fruits can range from green to yellow to purple, and mature size can range from dwarf varieties to those that reach 30 feet tall. The most common fig in the United States is the Smyrna fig variety.","tags":["fig","fig tree","fig varieties","fruit trees","plants"],"default_image":null},{"id":1113,"question":"Could fig trees tolerate colder climates?","answer":"Fig trees generally do not tolerate colder climates, as they prefer warm temperatures and thrive best in acidic, well-drained soil. Fig trees can tolerate some frost and cold temperatures, but if temperatures go lower than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, the tree will likely die. If fig trees in colder regions must be grown, some protection from cold winter temperatures will be needed, such as providing additional insulation and mulch around the tree, and ensuring the tree is in an area with adequate airflow to keep temperatures moderate.","tags":["fig","fig tree","fruit tree","plants gardening","plants"],"default_image":null},{"id":1114,"question":"Could fig trees tolerate colder climates?","answer":"Yes, certain varieties of fig trees are able to tolerate cold climates. Depending on the particular variety, some fig trees can withstand temperatures as low as 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Many cold-tolerant fig trees will remain dormant over winter and will start blooming when the temperature rises. Cold-hardy figs can be planted in USDA hardiness zones 4-11, with the best growth results typically seen in the warmer parts of the zone.","tags":["fig","fig tree","plants gardening","fruit plants","fruit trees"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1114vEe164da6ecc1814012/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1114vEe164da6ecc1814012/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1114vEe164da6ecc1814012/medium.jpg"}},{"id":1115,"question":"Do fig trees have invasive root systems?","answer":"In general, fig trees do not have particularly invasive root systems. Depending on the climate and soil conditions, the fig tree's root system can spread out 6-12 feet from the trunk. In contrast to trees with invasive root systems, such as silver maple, which can spread their roots up to 40 feet away from the trunk, the fig tree is comparatively restrained in its root growth. Furthermore, many fig trees are grown in large pots or containers because of their smaller root system, making them popular for those who have limited garden space.","tags":["fig","fig tree","plants gardening","fruits plant","fruit trees"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1115Tr3K64da6f4dc0d0112/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1115Tr3K64da6f4dc0d0112/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1115Tr3K64da6f4dc0d0112/medium.jpg"}},{"id":1116,"question":"Do fig trees produce flowers?","answer":"Yes, fig trees produce flowers. They produce small, yellowish flowers that have petals that are fused at the base. These flowers grow in specialized clusters called synconia, which are housed in hollow, fleshy receptacles known as syconium. These flowers mostly self-pollinate or are pollinated by small wasps, although wind can blow some of their pollen to other flowers for cross-pollination. After pollination, the flowers develop into tiny fruits that eventually grow into figs.","tags":["fig","fig tree","fig fruits","plants gardening","fruit plants"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1116NUPw64da705c775c512/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1116NUPw64da705c775c512/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1116NUPw64da705c775c512/medium.jpg"}},{"id":1117,"question":"Could fig trees be grown in containers?","answer":"Yes, fig trees can absolutely be grown in containers. Growing fig trees in a container offers many benefits, such as portability, easy maintenance and being able to bring the tree indoors during winter months. Fig trees grow best in well-draining soil, and their roots need plenty of room. When selecting a pot for a fig tree, opt for one with a diameter of 24 inches or more. Additionally, the tree should be watered regularly and allowed to drain completely before any additional water is added. When potted fig trees are given the right care, they will reward their owners with plenty of figs each season.","tags":["fig","fig tree","plants gardening","fruit plants","fruits"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1117WFEq64da710a3ef6312/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1117WFEq64da710a3ef6312/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_1117WFEq64da710a3ef6312/medium.jpg"}},{"id":1118,"question":"Is the fig tree drought-resistant?","answer":"Yes, the fig tree is a drought-resistant plant.
