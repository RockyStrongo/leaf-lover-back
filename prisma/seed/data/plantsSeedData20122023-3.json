Avoid pruning maples heavily while they are still establishing themselves, as this can slow down growth and reduce flowering."}],"faqs":[]},{"plant":{"id":157,"common_name":"Commemoration Sugar Maple","scientific_name":["Acer saccharum 'Commemoration'"],"other_name":["Hard Maple","Rock Maple","Hard Maple","Bird's Eye Maple","Curly Maple","Sweet Maple","Northern Sugar Maple","Head Maple"],"family":"Sapindaceae","origin":["United States"],"type":"tree","dimension":"Height:  50 feet","dimensions":{"type":"Height","min_value":50,"max_value":50,"unit":"feet"},"cycle":"Perennial","attracts":[],"propagation":["Grafting Propagation","Cutting","Layering Propagation","Air Layering Propagation","Tissue Culture"],"hardiness":{"min":"4","max":"4"},"hardiness_location":{"full_url":"https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=157&size=og&key=sk-BIlZ65689a5fb7aa13215","full_iframe":"<iframe frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless=seamless width=1000 height=550 style='margin:auto;' src='https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=157&size=og&key=sk-BIlZ65689a5fb7aa13215'></iframe>"},"watering":"Average","depth_water_requirement":{"unit":"inch","value":"1"},"volume_water_requirement":[],"watering_period":null,"watering_general_benchmark":{"value":"7-10","unit":"days"},"plant_anatomy":[],"sunlight":["full sun","part sun/part shade"],"pruning_month":["March","April","March","April","May","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","May"],"pruning_count":[],"seeds":1,"maintenance":null,"care-guides":"http://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id=157&key=sk-BIlZ65689a5fb7aa13215","soil":["Sand"," Loam"," Humus Enriched"],"growth_rate":"Low","drought_tolerant":false,"salt_tolerant":false,"thorny":false,"invasive":false,"tropical":false,"indoor":false,"care_level":"Medium","pest_susceptibility":[],"pest_susceptibility_api":"Coming Soon","flowers":true,"flowering_season":null,"flower_color":"Yellow|Green/Brown","cones":false,"fruits":true,"edible_fruit":false,"edible_fruit_taste_profile":"Coming Soon","fruit_nutritional_value":"Coming Soon","fruit_color":["green","yellow","brown"],"harvest_season":"Fall","leaf":true,"leaf_color":["gold","green","yellow"],"edible_leaf":false,"cuisine":false,"medicinal":false,"poisonous_to_humans":0,"poisonous_to_pets":0,"description":"Commemoration Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum 'Commemoration') is a very special species of maple tree.

An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot.
