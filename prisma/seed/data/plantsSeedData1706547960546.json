Start by removing all dead, damaged, and diseased branches and stems. Cut back any stems that are growing in the wrong direction. Prune all stems that are outgrowing other nearby stems. This will help maintain an even shape and avoid congestion.\n\nYou should also remove any flowers and seedpods to promote further leaf and stem growth.

Pruning in early spring, after the last frost, helps to control growth and maintain a neat appearance. Pruning will also help remove dead, diseased, or unsightly parts of the plant, and limit its spreading. When pruning the eryngo, determine what needs to be removed and use a sterile tool. Trim all dead or diseased parts back to healthy wood, and remove any stems that are growing in the wrong direction. Do not trim away more than 25% of the stems each year for healthy plants. If the eryngo appears to be growing too quickly, trim up to 50% of the stems back to the ground to control growth.

An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot.
