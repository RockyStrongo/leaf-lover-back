Water deeply and consistently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Generally, water the plant once a week during the growing season and once a month during the winter - depending on climate, season and soil conditions. Make sure the soil is pulling away from the sides of the pot before watering. If it’s not, wait a little longer before watering. Additionally, if your Epimedium pinnatum is planted in the ground, do not let the soil dry out completely between waterings."},{"id":182,"type":"sunlight","description":"Bishop’s hat (Epimedium pinnatum) is best suited to a site with partial to full shade. This plant requires 3 to 6 hours of partial sun for growth and flowering, preferably in the morning. It should be planted in an area that does not receive more than 4 to 5 hours of full sun, because direct sunlight can be too intense for this species. During the hottest part of the day, Bishop’s hat should be in the shade to avoid sunburn.

When pruning, avoid cutting off more than one-third of the plant’s foliage at a single time; otherwise, it can be difficult for the plant to recover its form."}],"faqs":[]}],"standAloneFaqs":[{"id":11,"question":"Do shade growing plants need any Sunlight?","answer":"Shade growing plants do need sunlight, although they require less than other plants. They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.","tags":["shade","sunlight","plant","exposure","half sun"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/medium.jpg"}},{"id":12,"question":"How often should you water indoor plants?","answer":"Indoor plants should be watered when the soil feels dry to a depth of about two inches, usually about once a week. A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot. Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.","tags":["root rot","disease","pest","monstera","overwater"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/medium.jpg"}},{"id":14,"question":"Can I put my Monstera outside in summer?","answer":"No, you should not put your Monstera outside in summer. Monstera plants need warm, humid air to thrive, and direct sunlight can scorch their leaves. Instead, put your Monstera in a bright, sunny spot with indirect light, making sure the sun never directly hits the leaves. During the summer, keep your Monstera's soil damp and mist it occasionally to keep the leaves hydrated. At nighttime, keep the temperature around 16 - 21°C (60 - 70°F).
