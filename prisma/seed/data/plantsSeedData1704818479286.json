Pruning should be done in the spring and, if overgrown, in the fall. \n\nTaking the time to prune your hemp agrimony will help to encourage new growth and prevent it from becoming overcrowded or weak. In spring, prune back any dead or diseased branches and thin out any overly crowded or weak stems. Also, cut back the old flowering stems to the basal leaves. Be sure to discard any pruned material to prevent the spread of pests or diseases. In the fall, after flowering, prune any weak branches and lightly shape the main stems if needed. Aim to prune away no more than a quarter of the total plant height. \n\nWith regular pruning, hemp agrimony will maintain its form and a pleasant appearance. Also, by pruning the dead stems, it will help it to remain healthy and encourage new foliage growth."}],"faqs":[]}],"standAloneFaqs":[{"id":11,"question":"Do shade growing plants need any Sunlight?","answer":"Shade growing plants do need sunlight, although they require less than other plants. They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.","tags":["shade","sunlight","plant","exposure","half sun"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/medium.jpg"}},{"id":12,"question":"How often should you water indoor plants?","answer":"Indoor plants should be watered when the soil feels dry to a depth of about two inches, usually about once a week. A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot.

","answer":"Yes, peonies can be grown in partial shade. While they require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day during the first half of the growing season, the second half is best if the plants can receive a few hours of shade. As long as the area is not completely shaded, the peonies should do well. These plants are also hardy, so they can generally thrive in a variety of locations.","tags":["peony","flower","plant","partial shade","peonies"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_48JQKs6435fb9e97af5/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_48JQKs6435fb9e97af5/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_48JQKs6435fb9e97af5/medium.jpg"}},{"id":49,"question":"Do Peonies require well-drained soil? ","answer":"Yes, peonies do require well-drained soil in order to grow and flourish. Planting them in heavy clay soil can cause the roots to rot, as the soil will stay wet for too long. To ensure good drainage and aeration, it is recommended that the soil is amended with organic matter like compost or peat moss. The soil should also be slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Additionally, peonies may need to be watered more often during the summer, as they are prone to wilt in hot temperatures.","tags":["peony","soil","plant","flower","fragrance"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/medium.jpg"}}]}
