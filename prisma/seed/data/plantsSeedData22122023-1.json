Additionally, it is important to not let the plant be in direct sunlight during the hottest hours of the day, such as between 11am and 3 pm, when the summer sun is at its strongest.

When pruning lightly, focus on removing any water shoots growing on the tree as well as any branches growing directly upwards. Heavier pruning can be done in stages, by removing about 1 third of the plant’s branches each year over a 3-year period, ensuring that the main branch structure is still kept intact.

Pruning should be done sparingly, focusing on removal of any broken, dead or diseased branches. If you desire a more formal shape, the central leader can be pruned slightly. If you want a more natural shape, selective thinning can be done, pruning back no more than 1-third of the growth each year. Always make sure to make clean cuts near to the branch collar, as this will help with healing and regrowth."}],"faqs":[]},{"plant":{"id":2925,"common_name":"European beech","scientific_name":["Fagus sylvatica 'Tricolor'"],"other_name":["Golden Fastigiate Beech","European Beech"],"family":"Fagaceae","origin":["Europe","Garden origin"],"type":"tree","dimension":"Height:  45 feet","dimensions":{"type":"Height","min_value":45,"max_value":45,"unit":"feet"},"cycle":"Perennial","attracts":[],"propagation":["Grafting Propagation"],"hardiness":{"min":"6","max":"6"},"hardiness_location":{"full_url":"https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2925&size=og&key=sk-ghsr6566116c66dd42947","full_iframe":"<iframe frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless=seamless width=1000 height=550 style='margin:auto;' src='https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2925&size=og&key=sk-ghsr6566116c66dd42947'></iframe>"},"watering":"Average","depth_water_requirement":[],"volume_water_requirement":[],"watering_period":null,"watering_general_benchmark":{"value":"7-10","unit":"days"},"plant_anatomy":[],"sunlight":["Full sun"],"pruning_month":["February","December","January","February"],"pruning_count":{"amount":1,"interval":"yearly"},"seeds":0,"maintenance":"Low","care-guides":"http://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id=2925&key=sk-ghsr6566116c66dd42947","soil":["Well-drained"],"growth_rate":"Moderate","drought_tolerant":false,"salt_tolerant":false,"thorny":false,"invasive":false,"tropical":false,"indoor":false,"care_level":"Medium","pest_susceptibility":["Rodents","  Pest resistant"," Disease resistant "],"pest_susceptibility_api":"Coming Soon","flowers":true,"flowering_season":"Spring","flower_color":"Not showy, Green-yellow","cones":false,"fruits":true,"edible_fruit":false,"edible_fruit_taste_profile":"Coming Soon","fruit_nutritional_value":"Coming Soon","fruit_color":["green","yellow","brown"],"harvest_season":"Fall","leaf":true,"leaf_color":["green","yellow","pink"],"edible_leaf":false,"cuisine":false,"medicinal":false,"poisonous_to_humans":0,"poisonous_to_pets":0,"description":"European beech 'Tricolor' is an amazing plant species.

The best way to do this is to soak the soil thoroughly and then allow it to slightly dry out before watering again. Watering too frequently can cause root rot, so try to stick to the once weekly watering schedule. During the summer, hot days may require additional watering, however, it is important not to overdo it. If the soil stays too wet for too long, it can become waterlogged and suffocate the roots of the plants."},{"id":12084,"type":"sunlight","description":"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea 'Jaguar 3') does best in full sunlight, meaning at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day. In areas that receive more than 8 hours of direct sunlight a day, tall fescue will benefit from a few hours of partial shade in the afternoon. Generally, the more sun it receives, the better it will grow and produce its attractive foliage. Tall fescue has a higher tolerance for sun than some other grasses, allowing it to thrive in sunnier climates."},{"id":12085,"type":"pruning","description":"Tall fescue should be pruned in late spring, or specifically between April and June, unless the weather remains cool during that time. During this pruning season, it is best to cut away up to 1-third of the height of the grass clumps. Pruning can be continued over the summer months if necessary, but should be avoided in late summer and early fall when the grass is going to seed or undergoing dormancy. Pruning in late summer and early fall may reduce the plant's vigor, leading to poor performance and increased susceptibility to disease."}],"faqs":[]}],"standAloneFaqs":[{"id":11,"question":"Do shade growing plants need any Sunlight?","answer":"Shade growing plants do need sunlight, although they require less than other plants. They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.","tags":["shade","sunlight","plant","exposure","half sun"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_11lvhD6435fb7b5c627/medium.jpg"}},{"id":12,"question":"How often should you water indoor plants?","answer":"Indoor plants should be watered when the soil feels dry to a depth of about two inches, usually about once a week. A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot. Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.","tags":["root rot","disease","pest","monstera","overwater"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/medium.jpg"}},{"id":14,"question":"Can I put my Monstera outside in summer?","answer":"No, you should not put your Monstera outside in summer.
