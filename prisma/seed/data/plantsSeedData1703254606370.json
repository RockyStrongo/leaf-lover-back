It is important to remember to sterilize pruning tools being used on Snow on the Mountain to avoid disease transmission. In addition, pruning should be limited to no more than 1/3 of the total plant in any single season.

Next, remove the lower leaves and dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone. Finally, plant the cutting in moist soil and make sure the cut end is facing downward. Place the cuttings in a warm, humid place and make sure to keep the soil moist. Within several weeks, the poinsettia should take root and start to grow.","tags":["poinsettia","plant propagate","stemcutting","plants","gardening"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_277pJFl6435fc6b6688f/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_277pJFl6435fc6b6688f/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_277pJFl6435fc6b6688f/medium.jpg"}},{"id":278,"question":"Is poinsettia annual or perennial plant?","answer":"Poinsettia is a perennial plant, although it is commonly grown as an annual for the holiday season.

To make a dye from poinsettia petals, you will need to boil the petals in water for about an hour to extract the most vivid hue. The longer you boil them, the more intense your hue will be. You can also dry the petals and grind them up to make a finer powder. The powder or solution can be used to dye proteins or cellulose fabrics, including fabrics like wool, cotton, and silk.

Poinsettias are slow-growing plants that can stay in the same pot for up to a year and a half. However, you should check the plant’s roots regularly to make sure they are receiving enough oxygen and water. If roots become too dense, you can repot the poinsettia into a slightly larger pot.

To do so, carefully begin by selecting a stem that is healthy, vibrant and free from damage. Cut the stem below a leaf node using sterilized scissors. Place the stem in a jar of lukewarm water until a callous appears on the end of the cut (this should take one to two weeks). When the callous has formed, transfer the stem to a pot of moistened soil and position the pot in bright, indirect light.
