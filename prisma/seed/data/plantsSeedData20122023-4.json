Not only is it a breathtaking sight, but its small size is perfect for small gardens. It is a self-pollinating variety and produces dark-skinned fruit with a sweet, rich taste. It is a fast-growing tree and needs well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight to reach its full potential. Its compact size allows it to fit into tight areas and bring life to even the smallest garden. The additional benefit of the Petite Negra variety is its cold hardiness, as it can withstand temperatures down to -13Â° Fahrenheit!

You can supplement with additional water during periods of drought, but be careful not to over water your fig tree as this can lead to root rot. Water should be applied around the base of the tree, ensuring that the soil is kept moist throughout the entire root system. Allow the soil to dry out somewhat between waterings.

For common figs, it is best to prune the tree in late winter, just before the active growth period begins. Prune cautiously to retain the desired shape and vigor of the tree. Prune out overgrown branches and any dead or diseased wood. For best production, prune out any weak or congested wood and open up the tree's canopy to better capture sunlight.

There are over 750 species, including the common edible fig as well as ornamental figs such as the Lebanese and Tiger Eye figs. Figs can be found in many climates and soils, with some that are semi-tropical and cold hardy. Fruits can range from green to yellow to purple, and mature size can range from dwarf varieties to those that reach 30 feet tall. The most common fig in the United States is the Smyrna fig variety.","tags":["fig","fig tree","fig varieties","fruit trees","plants"],"default_image":null}]},{"plant":{"id":2961,"common_name":"Indian rubberplant","scientific_name":["Ficus elastica"],"other_name":["India rubber plant","rubber tree"],"family":"Moraceae","origin":["Southeastern Asia"],"type":"Broadleaf evergreen","dimension":"50.00 to 100.00 feet","dimensions":{"type":null,"min_value":50,"max_value":100,"unit":"feet"},"cycle":"Perennial","attracts":[],"propagation":["Layering Propagation","Stem Propagation"],"hardiness":{"min":"10","max":"12"},"hardiness_location":{"full_url":"https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2961&size=og&key=sk-s2Yp6566120c66d243170","full_iframe":"<iframe frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless=seamless width=1000 height=550 style='margin:auto;' src='https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2961&size=og&key=sk-s2Yp6566120c66d243170'></iframe>"},"watering":"Average","depth_water_requirement":[],"volume_water_requirement":[],"watering_period":null,"watering_general_benchmark":{"value":"7-10","unit":"days"},"plant_anatomy":[],"sunlight":["full sun","part sun/part shade"],"pruning_month":["February","March","April"],"pruning_count":{"amount":1,"interval":"yearly"},"seeds":0,"maintenance":"Low","care-guides":"http://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id=2961&key=sk-s2Yp6566120c66d243170","soil":["Humus rich"," Well-drained"],"growth_rate":"Moderate","drought_tolerant":true,"salt_tolerant":false,"thorny":false,"invasive":false,"tropical":false,"indoor":true,"care_level":"Medium","pest_susceptibility":["Fungal leaf spot"," Scale insects"],"pest_susceptibility_api":"Coming Soon","flowers":true,"flowering_season":null,"flower_color":"No flowers, Red, Green","cones":false,"fruits":true,"edible_fruit":false,"edible_fruit_taste_profile":"Coming Soon","fruit_nutritional_value":"Coming Soon","fruit_color":["green"],"harvest_season":"Summer","leaf":true,"leaf_color":["green","yellow","burgundy"],"edible_leaf":false,"cuisine":false,"medicinal":false,"poisonous_to_humans":0,"poisonous_to_pets":0,"description":"The Indian Rubberplant, or Ficus elastica, is an amazing species for houseplant lovers looking for a dramatic statement piece.
