A good way to gauge this is to stick your finger into the soil and check the moisture level. During the growing season (spring through fall), it is recommended to water the fennel plant every 7-10 days, giving enough water to evenly moisten the soil. Depending on your climate, you may need to increase or decrease the frequency of watering as necessary. In the winter months, fennel should be watered only sparingly."

Pruning helps to keep the plant looking neat and tidy and encourages new growth. It can also encourage a bushier plant with more flowering stems. \n\nTo prune Fennel, begin by removing dead and damaged stems. Next, thin any tall, spindly stems, as well as any crossing, overcrowded or weak stems. Cut these down to a healthy lateral stem, cutting at least 1-third below the existing growth tip. Allow the remaining stems to remain in place, but trim them back to the desired height (generally, this is between 18-24 inches). Finally, tip-prune the remaining stem tips, cutting back a few inches to encourage bushy growth. This should be done annually in the early spring, before the plant begins to actively grow."

Remove crossing or intertwined branches, as well as any overly-long branches. If needed, thin out the branches for better air circulation, but take care not to remove too many in 1 season. You may also prune for aesthetics, such as removing branches that detract from the natural look of the tree.

This is usually around late February or March for most climates. Forsythia 'Arnold Dwarf' flowers before the foliage emerges so it is important to prune only after flowering has finished in order to not affect the plant’s blooming.\n\nAmount of pruning depends on the desired shape of the plant. This species of Forsythia has an upright-arching habit but can educated to fit in a smaller space will need more pruning. The main goal of pruning is to keep the plant healthy and encourage more flowering. When pruning, focus on removing only dead, broken and diseased branches. Remove no more than 1/3 of the plant in a single season otherwise it may not bloom."

To avoid over-watering, allow the soil to dry out slightly between watering. The best way to check if your plant needs water is to stick your finger in the soil up to the first knuckle - if the soil is still damp, wait a few days to water. In the summer months, the plant may need more frequent watering, especially if it is in a pot, as the dryer air and soil may cause it to dry out faster. In the winter months, be sure to reduce the amount of water and allow the soil to stay on the dry side."

They need at least 5 to 6 hours of direct sunlight throughout the day for optimal health and flower production. During periods of extreme heat, they like some afternoon shade, though too much shade will reduce flower production. In the mornings, it's best to keep the intense sun off of them, so placing the plants in the partial shade during this time will benefit them. With proper sunlight and a regular maintenance routine, Forsythia 'Courtacour' GOLDILOCKS will bring abundant blooms and bright colors to your garden throughout the spring and summer."

Cut all side branches back to half their length, as well as any dead, diseased, or damaged branches. It should be pruned to maintain a pleasing shape and to encourage the development of healthful new growth. To ensure abundant flowers, wait until after they have bloomed in the spring before pruning. It is best to approach pruning a Forsythia 'Courtacour' GOLDILOCKS thoughtfully and with a plan in mind, as pruning can be somewhat severe and will remove flowers if done incorrectly."

During this period, ample water should be provided, approximately once a week, in the form of deep watering. Water should be applied slowly and deeply to avoid soil erosion or runoff. Soil should be monitored to ensure that it remains moist but not soggy. Watering can be reduced once flowering has stopped, usually in late spring to early summer. During the summer, less frequent watering is recommended, approximately every 2 weeks. However, if the plant is in an exposed area or during times of extreme temperatures, more frequent watering may be necessary. Additionally, mulching the soil around the plant will help keep the moisture in and help reduce the need for frequent watering. As autumn approaches, gradually reduce the frequency of watering should be reduced. In winter, Forsythia ‘Courtasol’ GOLD TIDE should only be watered as needed."

In general, Forsythia 'Fiesta' plants will thrive with more sun than shade and will need several hours of direct sunlight for health and flowering. The best time for sun exposure is in the morning, when the temperature is lower and the sun is brightest. This will encourage new growth and promote healthy blooms."

                    "description": "For Forsythia 'Fiesta', pruning should done annually in late winter or early spring. The amount of pruning depends on the desired shape and size of the shrub. For the first year after planting, cut back all the stems to about 8 to 12 inches, then allow it to re-grow to the desired height within the next 4 to 6 months. For subsequent years, prune out a small amount of the older wood and trim back wayward branches to the desired shape, leaving strong buds or branches that will grow from the center. This will encourage a more bushier growth form and help reduce the chance of creating a bare center."

You can also selectively prune away a few of the older stems at ground level, again to encourage the growth of younger stems that will have more flowers. Avoid over-pruning, as it can promote leggy growth and decrease flowering."

This plant typically blooms in late winter/early spring, so it's important to prune before the flowers appear. \n\nStart by removing dead, diseased and damaged wood. Then, thin out any crowded or weak branches. This will increase airflow and ensure good growth. Prune branches back to their point of origin and maintain a generally rounded shape. \n\nIt's important to give border forsythia a good trim every 2-3 years to encourage new growth and flowering. However, if it gets overly large or unruly it can be pruned more often. Light pruning can be done throughout the growing season as well, if needed."

As a rule, water early in the morning so that any excess moisture on the foliage can evaporate before nightfall and help reduce the risk of fungal diseases.

Be sure to remove any dead or damaged stems, and do not prune more than 1 third of the stems from the shrub in a single session to avoid shock to the plant.

When pruning, cuts should be made on a slight angle roughly 1-third of the way into the previous year's growth. Regular pruning will help keep the shrub looking neat and encourage more prolific flowering."

                "description": "Forsythia 'Meadowlark' is an amazing plant that will make any yard stand out. It's a beautiful yellow flowering shrub with climbing vines that will cascade down sides of walls and containers. Each branch is covered in abundant, bright yellow blooms in early spring and gives an eye-catching display each year. Its small and upright form is perfect for smaller gardens, and its adaptable nature means it can tolerate a wide range of soil types. It is also very low maintenance and can usually thrive with little to no pruning. With its vibrant colors and long lasting blooms, its recognition as an excellent garden ornamental plant is well deserved.",

Pruning time will depend upon the climate of the area as bud break typically begins as early as late February in mild-winter areas and as late as April in colder climates.\n\nWhen pruning, make sure to remove no more than 1-third of the oldest branches each year. This will result in a healthier, more vigorous shrub. Begin pruning by removing any dead, dying, or diseased branches. Next, remove any branches that are crossing over each other. Finally, you can begin trimming back the branches to the desired shape. When finished, make sure the Forsythia is still a manageable size."

Harder pruning should be limited to about 1-third of the size of the shrub. Be sure to remove any suckers from the base.

This will help to promote healthy growth and maintain the attractive, cascading shape of the plants. Minor pruning can be done every 1-2 years to remove any old, damaged, or diseased stems, while more significant pruning may be done every 3-5 years. When pruning, it is important to remove any branches that are crossing over 1 another, or growing too tightly together, to allow for good air flow and to keep the plant healthy. As well, thinning out any excessively long stems or those that are growing away from the desired form can help keep your Weeping Forsythia looking neat and attractive."

This will help increase air circulation and allow more light to reach the interior of the plant. Prune back young forsythia stems that have occurred in the previous season by about 1 third. This will help bring the plant back into shape. For mature forsythia that have stopped blooming, wait until after flowering has ended and then cut the stems back by up to 1 third.

The exact frequency will depend on local climate and soil conditions. Generally speaking, water the greenstem forsythia deeply once every 10 to 13 days in cooler weather and every 7 to 10 days in warmer weather. Make sure the soil is damp to the touch but not overly wet. Mulching around the base of the plant can help keep soil moisture consistent. During dry, hot weather, greenstem forsythia may appreciate 1 deep watering per week for optimal health."

                    "description": "Greenstem forsythia should be pruned twice a year for optimal growth and shape. Prune in late winter just before new spring growth begins, and again in mid summer after flowers have faded. When pruning during winter, wait until after all the cold weather has passed. This will help reduce the potential of dieback from frost damage. Be sure to remove any deadwood first, as well as any overly-long branches that may have grown beyond the desired shape of the plant. When pruning in mid-summer, conservatively trim back only the spent flower heads, and avoid shearing the plant. Shearing will decrease the width and density of the entire shrub. New flowering branches should only be cut back when absolutely necessary, such as when a branch is growing too tall. Make sure to leave at least a few inches between new cuts and previous cuts. This will help promote branching and increase the density of the shrub."

            "answer": "Shade growing plants do need sunlight, although they require less than other plants. They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.",

            "answer": "Indoor plants should be watered when the soil feels dry to a depth of about two inches, usually about once a week. A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.",

            "answer": "Yes, a plant can get root rot. Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.",

            "question": "Do Snake Plants have a long lifespan?",
            "answer": "Yes, snake plants (also known as mother-in-law's tongue) have a long lifespan. They can live for several years, up to 10-15 years if given proper care. Snake plants are very hardy houseplants, needing minimal attention and able to tolerate a wide range of growing conditions. They are also drought tolerant, making them relatively low maintenance plants. With proper care and good conditions, the lifespan of a snake plant can easily be extended to over 20 years.",

            "answer": "Yes, Snake Plants are very tolerant to low light environments and they can survive in almost any kind of light, including fluorescent lighting. They can even survive in areas with no natural light at all. Snake Plants are extremely hardy and can handle a wide range of light conditions, including both direct and indirect light. However, the plants may not thrive or grow as lush or as quickly as plants in brighter light, but they will still survive.",

            "question": "Should Snake Plants be watered frequently?",
            "answer": "No, snake plants should not be watered frequently. Snake plants are hardy, drought-tolerant plants, and can withstand dry periods of time. They thrive on limited water, so over-watering can cause their roots to rot. Typically, it is recommended to water snake plants every two to four weeks, depending upon the season. Be sure to always check soil moisture before adding more water, as too much water can cause the leaves to turn yellow or brown.",

            "answer": "Yes, peonies do require well-drained soil in order to grow and flourish. Planting them in heavy clay soil can cause the roots to rot, as the soil will stay wet for too long. To ensure good drainage and aeration, it is recommended that the soil is amended with organic matter like compost or peat moss. The soil should also be slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Additionally, peonies may need to be watered more often during the summer, as they are prone to wilt in hot temperatures.",
