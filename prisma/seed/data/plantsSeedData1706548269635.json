Additionally, Devil's Ivy has been known to help filter indoor air and remove pollutants such as xylene and formaldehyde from the environment, which makes it a great choice for providing a healthier indoor environment.","tags":["devil's ivy","pothos","grow","garden plants","plants"],"default_image":null},{"id":88,"question":"Can Devil's Ivy be grown in low light conditions? ","answer":"Yes, Devil's Ivy (or pothos) is an extremely resilient plant that can tolerate low-light conditions. It is an ideal plant for indoors as it will not only survive in low-light areas but thrive in them, too. The plant will become more lush and vibrant in medium and bright light but, as long as you are not trying to keep a pristine look, will be happy in low-light, too. Devil's Ivy is one of the most common houseplants and is a classic standby for dimly lit areas in the home or office.","tags":["devil's Ivy","phothos","lowlight plants","indoorplants","gardenplants"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_88H3Iz6435fbaee6b6b/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_88H3Iz6435fbaee6b6b/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_88H3Iz6435fbaee6b6b/medium.jpg"}},{"id":89,"question":"Could Devil's Ivy help improve indoor air quality? ","answer":"Yes, Devil's Ivy (or Epipremnum aureum) can help improve indoor air quality. This plant is a natural air purifier, capable of removing toxic gases like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from a room. Additionally, the plant also absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into a room, improving the air circulation and increasing the amount of oxygen available for breathing. Its evergreen foliage, climbing ropes, and cascading vines also gives an aesthetic flair to any interior design. By purifying the air, Devil's Ivy can help create a healthier indoor environment.","tags":["devil's Ivy","pothos","airpurifierplants","indoorplants","gardenplants"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_89Yuv66435fbaf5412a/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_89Yuv66435fbaf5412a/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_89Yuv66435fbaf5412a/medium.jpg"}},{"id":90,"question":"Should I keep Devil's Ivy away from pets and children? ","answer":"It is strongly recommended that you keep Devil's Ivy away from both pets and children. Devil's Ivy, also known as pothos or Scindapsus aureus, is poisonous to both pets and children if ingested. If any part of the plant is ingested, it can cause mouth or throat irritation, excessive drooling, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, it is best to keep the plant out of reach and safe from pets and children.","tags":["devil's Ivy","pothos","pets","gardenplants","indoorplants"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_909MAE6435fbafc93c9/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_909MAE6435fbafc93c9/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_909MAE6435fbafc93c9/medium.jpg"}},{"id":286,"question":"Are there any companion plants that pair well with Poinsettia?","answer":"There are several companion plants that pair well with a Poinsettia. Trailing plants can be planted in pots that match or complement the poinsettia, such as English ivy, pothos, or philodendron. Other lush foliage plants like dieffenbachia, snake plant, and ferns look great when planted together in one pot.

A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot. Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.","tags":["root rot","disease","pest","monstera","overwater"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_13Y7nX6435fb7c71c37/medium.jpg"}},{"id":14,"question":"Can I put my Monstera outside in summer?","answer":"No, you should not put your Monstera outside in summer.

","answer":"Yes, peonies do require well-drained soil in order to grow and flourish. Planting them in heavy clay soil can cause the roots to rot, as the soil will stay wet for too long. To ensure good drainage and aeration, it is recommended that the soil is amended with organic matter like compost or peat moss. The soil should also be slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Additionally, peonies may need to be watered more often during the summer, as they are prone to wilt in hot temperatures.","tags":["peony","soil","plant","flower","fragrance"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_49aOWU6435fb9eeee66/medium.jpg"}}]}
