When watering, aim to moisten the entire root zone, not just the surface. It is ideal to water in the early morning, as this is when the plant can make best use of the water. Wet foliage in the heat of the day can cause issues with mildew. After watering, allow the soil to drain completely and discard any water that collects in the saucer or pot."

They need plenty of bright, indirect light to grow strong and healthy, and can suffer from too much direct light, sunburn or possible plant death. If lisianthus is growing outdoors in direct sunlight, shade it during the hottest and brightest parts of the day and keep it out of strong winds in the garden. In colder climates, lisianthus can be grown outdoors if placed in a spot with some protection from the wind."

Prune lisianthus plants when the stems begin to grow taller than 12 inches. Remove some of the longest stems, leaving some of the buds at the base of the stem, which will help create fuller, bushier growth. Prune lisianthus in the spring or early summer for optimal blooming. Furthermore, remove any dead or wilted stems and remove any flower heads that have already bloomed."

            "answer": "Shade growing plants do need sunlight, although they require less than other plants. They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.",

            "answer": "Indoor plants should be watered when the soil feels dry to a depth of about two inches, usually about once a week. A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.",

            "answer": "Yes, a plant can get root rot. Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.",

Instead, put your Monstera in a bright, sunny spot with indirect light, making sure the sun never directly hits the leaves. During the summer, keep your Monstera's soil damp and mist it occasionally to keep the leaves hydrated. At nighttime, keep the temperature around 16 - 21°C (60 - 70°F). You can definitely take your Monstera outdoors for short periods of time, just make sure to bring it back in if it starts to get too hot.",

Cold temperatures can damage the leaves of the plant, causing them to become spotted or limp. The roots of monstera plants may also suffer in cold temperatures, leading to root rot or other diseases. Belonging to the tropical family, monsteras are used to warm environments and do not do well in cold temperatures, so it is important to ensure your plant is kept in conditions that suit their needs.",

            "answer": "Yes, spider plants are known to be one of the most effective houseplants at removing common air pollutants. Spider plants absorb gaseous formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and xylene from indoor air and convert it into oxygen. They also convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during the day, helping to freshen the air in your home or office. Spider plants also help to reduce indoor humidity levels. They are an excellent choice for improving indoor air quality.",

            "answer": "Yes, spider plants are a very easy to care for houseplant that actually prefers a low light condition. They will usually thrive in a bright indirect light area of the home but can easily adapt to lower light conditions. Spider plants are very resilient and can even withstand a few weeks of low light levels before the plants start to suffer.",

            "answer": "Yes, snake plants (also known as mother-in-law's tongue) have a long lifespan. They can live for several years, up to 10-15 years if given proper care. Snake plants are very hardy houseplants, needing minimal attention and able to tolerate a wide range of growing conditions. They are also drought tolerant, making them relatively low maintenance plants. With proper care and good conditions, the lifespan of a snake plant can easily be extended to over 20 years.",

They can even survive in areas with no natural light at all. Snake Plants are extremely hardy and can handle a wide range of light conditions, including both direct and indirect light. However, the plants may not thrive or grow as lush or as quickly as plants in brighter light, but they will still survive.",

            "answer": "No, snake plants should not be watered frequently. Snake plants are hardy, drought-tolerant plants, and can withstand dry periods of time. They thrive on limited water, so over-watering can cause their roots to rot. Typically, it is recommended to water snake plants every two to four weeks, depending upon the season. Be sure to always check soil moisture before adding more water, as too much water can cause the leaves to turn yellow or brown.",

These plants are highly efficient at removing a range of toxins from the air, including volatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and benzene. Studies have shown that snake plants can reduce indoor air pollutants by as much as 40 to 60 percent when placed strategically around the home. Furthermore, these plants are low-maintenance, easy to care for, and virtually indestructible, making them an ideal choice for those looking to clean up their air quality without spending much time or money.",

To ensure good drainage and aeration, it is recommended that the soil is amended with organic matter like compost or peat moss. The soil should also be slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Additionally, peonies may need to be watered more often during the summer, as they are prone to wilt in hot temperatures.",
