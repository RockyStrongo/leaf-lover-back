An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.","tags":["water willow","water arum","water birch","indoor","water"],"default_image":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/og.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/regular.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/article_faq/faq_12efgB6435fb7bf140d/medium.jpg"}},{"id":13,"question":"Can my monstera plant get root rot?","answer":"Yes, a plant can get root rot.
