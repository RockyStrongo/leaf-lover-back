However, it can be pruned following the dormant season - typically late winter/early spring – to shape the growth and prevent it from becoming too dense. Generally, no more than 10% of the new growth should be removed at any given time. Pruning can be done manually with hand pruning shears or a small saw, or with hedge trimmers if desired. While removing growth, it's important to avoid cutting into established woody stems, as this can cause severe damage and stress."}],"faqs":[]},{"plant":{"id":2716,"common_name":"autumn olive","scientific_name":["Elaeagnus umbellata"],"other_name":[],"family":"Elaeagnaceae","origin":["Eastern Asia"],"type":"Deciduous shrub","dimension":"10.00 to 16.00 feet","dimensions":{"type":null,"min_value":10,"max_value":16,"unit":"feet"},"cycle":"Perennial","attracts":[],"propagation":["Seed Propagation","Cutting","Layering Propagation","Grafting Propagation","Division"],"hardiness":{"min":"4","max":"9"},"hardiness_location":{"full_url":"https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2716&size=og&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956","full_iframe":"<iframe frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless=seamless width=1000 height=550 style='margin:auto;' src='https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2716&size=og&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956'></iframe>"},"watering":"Average","depth_water_requirement":{"unit":"","value":""},"volume_water_requirement":[],"watering_period":null,"watering_general_benchmark":{"value":"7-10","unit":"days"},"plant_anatomy":[],"sunlight":["Full sun","part shade"],"pruning_month":["September","October","November","May","May","June","September","October","November"],"pruning_count":[],"seeds":1,"maintenance":"Moderate","care-guides":"http://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id=2716&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956","soil":[],"growth_rate":"High","drought_tolerant":true,"salt_tolerant":true,"thorny":true,"invasive":true,"tropical":false,"indoor":false,"care_level":"Medium","pest_susceptibility":[],"pest_susceptibility_api":"Coming Soon","flowers":true,"flowering_season":null,"flower_color":"Slivery white to dull yellow","cones":false,"fruits":true,"edible_fruit":true,"edible_fruit_taste_profile":"Coming Soon","fruit_nutritional_value":"Coming Soon","fruit_color":["yellow","orange"],"harvest_season":"Fall","leaf":true,"leaf_color":["silver","green"],"edible_leaf":true,"cuisine":true,"medicinal":true,"poisonous_to_humans":0,"poisonous_to_pets":1,"description":"The Autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) is an incredibly amazing species of plant found across much of North America.

They need to be kept consistently moist, but not saturated, so water them thoroughly until the soil is damp but not muddy. Do this about once every week or 2, depending on the weather conditions and how much water your soil holds. If the soil is dry an inch below the surface, give it a deep soaking. Soil should always be slightly damp to keep the roots healthy and to ensure enough oxygen and nutrients can get to the roots.

During the hottest parts of the day, such as midsummer, shade may provide a useful respite for the plant from the intense heat. During the spring and summer, it's important to expose autumn olive plants to full sunlight, since this helps them develop strong stems and larger leaves.

Since autumn olives have a high growth rate and can become very tall and wide, pruning should be done regularly to keep them in bounds. Pruning should be done to remove any dead, diseased, or broken branches, and to reduce overall size of the plant. As a general guideline, remove no more than 1/3 of the plant in 1 season, and keep pruning cuts at a 45-degree angle, just above an outward facing bud. Pruning at the wrong time or cutting too much can cause damage that can stress the plant, so take care not to overdo it."}],"faqs":[]},{"plant":{"id":2717,"common_name":"Chinese water chestnut","scientific_name":["Eleocharis dulcis"],"other_name":[],"family":"Cyperaceae","origin":["Asia"],"type":"Rush or Sedge","dimension":"1.00 to 3.00 feet","dimensions":{"type":null,"min_value":1,"max_value":3,"unit":"feet"},"cycle":"Perennial","attracts":[],"propagation":["Cormlet Propagation","Seed Propagation","Tissue Culture"],"hardiness":{"min":"9","max":"11"},"hardiness_location":{"full_url":"https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2717&size=og&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956","full_iframe":"<iframe frameborder=0 scrolling=yes seamless=seamless width=1000 height=550 style='margin:auto;' src='https://perenual.com/api/hardiness-map?species_id=2717&size=og&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956'></iframe>"},"watering":"Average","depth_water_requirement":[],"volume_water_requirement":[],"watering_period":null,"watering_general_benchmark":{"value":"2-3","unit":"days"},"plant_anatomy":[],"sunlight":["full sun","part shade"],"pruning_month":["May","June","July"],"pruning_count":[],"seeds":0,"maintenance":"Low","care-guides":"http://perenual.com/api/species-care-guide-list?species_id=2717&key=sk-2TIc65b7dfc996bb23956","soil":[],"growth_rate":"High","drought_tolerant":false,"salt_tolerant":true,"thorny":false,"invasive":true,"tropical":false,"indoor":false,"care_level":"Medium","pest_susceptibility":[],"pest_susceptibility_api":"Coming Soon","flowers":true,"flowering_season":null,"flower_color":"Yellow-brown","cones":false,"fruits":false,"edible_fruit":false,"edible_fruit_taste_profile":"Coming Soon","fruit_nutritional_value":"Coming Soon","fruit_color":[],"harvest_season":null,"leaf":false,"leaf_color":[],"edible_leaf":false,"cuisine":true,"medicinal":true,"poisonous_to_humans":0,"poisonous_to_pets":0,"description":"The Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) is an amazing plant species that provides a nutrient-rich snack.
